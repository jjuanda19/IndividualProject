# Individual Project
## Project Requirements
### Software Process Model
For this mobile app, an Agile process model has been chosen. Agile allows for iterative development, making it easier to adapt to changes and refine functionalities incrementally as the project evolves during the development phases. This approach also provides flexibility to make changes in requirements or features if necessary, adapting to unknowns, extending knowledge, and adjusting along the project timeline.

The Agile-driven model chosen will be a blend of Incremental Development and Integration and Configuration.

#### Incremental Development
Incremental Development involves building and delivering the application in small increments, allowing for gradual addition and refinement. Initially, basic functionalities such as location-based services will be implemented, followed by incremental additions of more complex features such as Machine Learning.

#### Benefits of Incremental Development
This approach enables early testing and collection of feedback, aiding in validating assumptions and ensuring that each increment adds value to the application.

#### Disadvantages of Incremental Development
Incremental development might lead to increased complexity as new features are continuously added.
Testing each increment might require additional effort, especially when integrating new functionalities.

#### Integration and Configuration
Integration and configuration are based on software reuse, where systems are integrated from existing components or application systems. In this project, it will be necessary to integrate location services, weather APIs, machine learning models, and the reminder system.

As the project progresses, new requirements or changes in user needs may not align with the initial incremental plan.

#### Benefits of Integration and Configuration
Proper integration ensures that different parts of the application interact effectively, providing accurate suggestions based on real-time data (such as weather) and user behavior.
#### Disadvantages of Integration and Configuration
Integrating different components, APIs, or services might lead to integration complexities. 

Configuration settings, especially when dealing with third-party APIs or services, might lead to errors or misconfigurations.

## User Requirements

1. Location-Bed Reminders, users can set reminders associated with specific geographic locations, triggering notifications upon entering or exiting these areas.
Reminder Customization:
2. Customizable reminder options including title, description, time, and frequency.
Ability to prioritize reminders and set recurring schedules as needed.
3. Easy-to-use interface for managing and editing existing reminders.
Snooze or dismiss options for reminders with flexibility in rescheduling. 
4. Allow users to create and customize their profiles, including preferences, interests, and notification settings.
5. Enable users to sync the application with their device's calendar, ensuring reminders and suggestions align with existing.
6. Users can create task list to help organize and manage their daily to-do lists alongside reminders and suggestions.

## System Requirements
1. Perfomance
    1. The application must respond to user actions within acceptable response  times.
    2. Location-based triggers should activate reminders promptly upon entering or exiting specified areas.
    3. Response times for triggering reminders upon entering or exiting specified locations should be within acceptable limits (e.g., seconds).
